# Welcome to ENGR 1110 Spring 2025!

I hope everyone had a great winter break! ENGR 1110 is a fun course, and I'm truly
looking forward to this semester. 

This course provides an introduction to engineering design, teamwork, beginning
programming, working with data, developing cultural intelligence, and other
concepts, all in the context of computer science and software engineering. That
sounds like a lot! But it's all done at a truly introductory level to prepare
you for a deeper dive into these topics later in your curriculum.

ENGR 1110 is a combined lecture/lab course that meets for 50 minutes each week
in lecture and for 150 minutes each week in lab. Lecture meets from 8:00 AM -
8:50 AM Mondays in Shelby 1103, and labs meet from 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM MWF in a
computer lab assigned to your particular course section. There are multiple
sections of the course, and they meet together for lecture and separately for
lab.

The **labs** don't meet the first week of classes, so the first lab meeting 
will be **Monday, January 20**.

See you in lecture Monday, January 13, and War Eagle!
