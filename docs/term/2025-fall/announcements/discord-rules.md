Here are some basic rules to keep in mind as you use this server.

1. Be polite, helpful, respectful, and constructive.

2. Don't post solutions to assignments, exams, or lab tests either before or after the due date.

3. You can post basic approaches that you take to a problem, at the "strategy" level - never the code level. Even then you may consider using the "spoiler alert" like this: ||secret text|| (double vertical bars).

4. Don't post your code at all, but also don't ask something vague like "Why doesn't this work?" Instead, describe the basic problem, what you have done in your attempts to solve it, and - when necessary - small (5-7 lines) pseudocode snippets like this:

```
if (some condition is true) {
	do this;
}
```
